Phoenix integration for the [Localize](https://hex.pm/packages/localize) library providing plugs for locale discovery, compile-time route localization, and HTML form helpers for localized data.

## Features

* **[Locale Discovery](https://hexdocs.pm/localize_web/http-locale-discovery.html)** — detect the user's locale from the accept-language header, query parameters, URL path, session, cookies, hostname TLD, or custom functions.

* **[Session Persistence](https://hexdocs.pm/localize_web/http-locale-discovery.html#persisting-locale-in-the-session)** — store the discovered locale in the session for subsequent requests and LiveView connections.

* **[Compile-time Route Localization](https://hexdocs.pm/localize_web/phoenix-localized-routing.html)** — translate route path segments using Gettext at compile time and generate localized routes for each configured locale.

* **[Verified Localized Routes](https://hexdocs.pm/localize_web/phoenix-localized-routing.html#verified-localized-routes-with-q)** — the `~q` sigil provides compile-time verified localized routes that dispatch to the correct translated path based on the current locale.

* **[HTML Form Helpers](https://hexdocs.pm/localize_web/localized-html-helpers.html)** — generate `<select>` tags and option lists for currencies, territories, territory subdivisions, locales, units of measure, and months with localized display names.

## Installation

Add `localize_web` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:localize_web, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

### Locale Discovery

Add the locale plugs to your Phoenix browser pipeline after `fetch_session`:

```elixir
pipeline :browser do
  plug :accepts, ["html"]
  plug :fetch_session

  plug Localize.Plug.PutLocale,
    from: [:session, :accept_language, :query, :path],
    gettext: MyApp.Gettext

  plug Localize.Plug.PutSession
end
```

`Localize.Plug.PutLocale` reads the `:session` source with
`Plug.Conn.get_session/2`, so `fetch_session` must run first. If `:cookie` is
used outside a browser/session pipeline, fetch cookies before `PutLocale`;
`fetch_session` already does that in the browser pipeline.

### LiveView Support

Add `Localize.LiveView` to the `on_mount` hooks of your live session. It sets the locale of a localized live route, also after a live navigation, and otherwise the locale from the session:

```elixir
live_session :default, on_mount: [{Localize.LiveView, gettext: MyApp.Gettext}] do
  localize do
    live "/dashboard", DashboardLive
  end
end
```

### Localized Routes

Configure your router with localized routes:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router
  use Localize.Routes, gettext: MyApp.Gettext

  localize do
    get "/pages/:page", PageController, :show
    resources "/users", UserController
  end
end
```

Provide translations in `priv/gettext/{locale}/LC_MESSAGES/routes.po` for each path segment.

### Verified Localized Routes

Use the `~q` sigil for compile-time verified localized paths:

```elixir
use Localize.VerifiedRoutes,
  router: MyApp.Router,
  endpoint: MyApp.Endpoint,
  gettext: MyApp.Gettext

# In templates:
~q"/users"
```

### HTML Helpers

Generate localized select tags in your templates:

```elixir
iex> Localize.HTML.Territory.select(:my_form, :territory, selected: :AU)
iex> Localize.HTML.Currency.select(:my_form, :currency, selected: :USD)
iex> Localize.HTML.Locale.select(:my_form, :locale, selected: "en")
```

## Acknowledgements

> #### Attribution {: .info}
>
> The localized routing in this library is based on `ex_cldr_routes` which was inspired by the work originally done by [Bart Otten](https://github.com/BartOtten) on `PhxAltRoutes` — which has evolved to the much enhanced [Routex](https://hex.pm/packages/routex). Users seeking a more comprehensive and extensible localized routing solution should consider [Routex](https://hex.pm/packages/routex) as an alternative to `Localize.Routes`.
